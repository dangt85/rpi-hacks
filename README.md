First Raspberry Pi hack

Installed:

* Raspberry Pi Cam
* PIR motion sensor (using 5v on GPIO17)
* Light Sensor (on GPIO24)
* LED (on GPIO25) - TODO
* DTH11 (Temp and Humid sensor) (5v on GPIO7)
* Sending email through outlook smpt

Next steps:

* calibrate sensor and adjust timming
* ~~try if capturing video is possible~~
* ~~add "entry lights" hack~~

* capture burstshot and include in email
* if video is not too long, include in email instead of image
